Title: Pipeline R package for creating simple gene signatures and testing their value in a clinical trial setting
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Prasad Patil <prpatil42@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package builds a simple, decision-tree based gene signature on a set of training data. The model-building and validation results are presented in an HTML report created by knitr. The resulting model can be evaluated as a baseline covariate in a clinical trial setting, with an accompanying report for that analysis as well.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), rpart, rattle, pROC, knitr
